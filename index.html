<h1>About Deers</h1>
<p>Being able to determine a deer's age when you're hunting is a major factor in controlling deer populations and promoting a diverse spectrum of ages among the deer. An important thing to keep in mind is that deer characteristics will vary depending on where the deer population is located. If you take your time and get to know the local wildlife, there are easy ways that you can age a deer by looking at it or by studying its teeth.</p>
